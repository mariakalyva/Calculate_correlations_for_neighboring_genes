# Calculate_correlations_for_neighboring_genes
Part of my thesis project

I wrote this small script in order to calculate correlations in neighboorhoods of genes, regarding their nucleosomes. My goal was to check how similar neighboring genes are in the way the nucleosomes form. I calculated nucleosomes for 10 gene neighborhoods if the genes co-localized in the same chromosome.
