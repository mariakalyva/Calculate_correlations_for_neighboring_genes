# Calculate_correlations_for_neighboring_genes
Part of my thesis project

I wrote this small script in order to calculate correlations of genomic neighborhoods, regarding their nucleosome positioning. My goal was to check how similar neighboring genes are in the way the nucleosomes position themselves. I calculated nucleosomes for 10 gene neighborhoods. The script checks if the genes belong to same chromosome- the data need to be sorted prior to use.
